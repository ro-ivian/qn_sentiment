6592493966,Facebook legal case 'divorced from reality',"The Full Federal Court has dismissed Facebook's claim that it neither conducts business nor collects personal information as ""divorced from reality"" in a withering judgment that approved a lawsuit over the Cambridge Analytica scandal.

Facebook, now known as Meta, was trying to block a lawsuit by the Australian Information Commissioner claiming it breached the privacy of more than 300,000 Australian users via a personality test app called This is Your Digital Life.

Facebook argued it could not be sued under Australia's privacy laws because it did not carry out business or collect or hold personal information in Australia - a proposition that was firmly rejected on Monday in a 3-0 decision.

Justice Nye Perram found the installation, operation and removal of cookies - text files used to identify computer users - on the devices of Australian users and the way people were logged in showed Facebook it was carrying out business in Australia.

""The problems with this submission are first that it proves far too much, and secondly that it is, with respect, divorced from reality,"" Justice Perram said.

""It proves too much because it has the consequence that no computer-based activity in one jurisdiction can ever amount to more than an effect in computers located in another.

""The submission has the result that no internet business based in one jurisdiction can ever carry on business in another.""

The Information Commissioner commenced proceedings in 2020, one of numerous other cases against Facebook/Meta across the globe. It had to obtain leave to proceed against Facebook because the social media giant is incorporated and based in the US.

Justice Perram noted that only 53 people in Australia installed the app, but it was able to access data from 311,127 people who were ""Facebook friends"".

It was then used by Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm that worked on Donald Trump's successful bid for the US presidency.

Justice Perram said there was ""an obvious distinction between an overseas website which provides data to an Australian computer when requested to do so, and an application that installs executable code on that computer"".

""Whilst Facebook Inc's description of what is occurring is not wrong, it is pitched at such a high level of generality that it is, in my respectful opinion, useless as a tool of analysis.

""One might also say that Facebook Inc had done no more than turn on and off vast numbers of tiny switches - a true statement since all computers operate solely by switching on and off binary digits - but the statement, whilst true, is not helpful for grasping anything about the activities which Facebook Inc is actually engaged in.

""By parity of reasoning, one learns little about art history by observing that Rembrandt's The Night Watch consists of some pigments on canvas in a wooden frame.""

Chief Justice James Allsop noted Facebook had complained about ""an unprecedented expansion of the concept of 'carrying on business' such that it would result in the ""world ... carrying on business in the world"".

""With respect, one should be wary of exaggeration ... the consequences for other online businesses in other areas of law which utilise the concept of 'carrying on business' are far from clear.""

Information Commissioner and Privacy Commissioner Angelene Falk welcomed the decision, which upheld an earlier ruling by Justice Angus Thawley, and said she ""looked forward to the hearing of substantive matters"".

""Justice Thawley was satisfied that the Commissioner had established a prima facie case that Facebook Inc was carrying on business in Australia, and was collecting and holding personal information in Australia at the relevant time.""

6686810990,Russian Aggression Triggers Unprecedented Response And What It Means For Brand Leadership,"With each passing day, more of the private sector is firing back against unprovoked Russian aggression on the sovereign democratic nation of Ukraine, adding to the crippling economic consequences heaped on Russia by unprecedented sanctions levied by 35+ countries-including historically neutral Switzerland.

In the past several days scores of major multinational companies have divested from Russian business interests, potentially sacrificing substantial profits to lead with conscience and stay on the right side of history.

Microsoft, Hermès, Spotify, Oracle, Airbnb, Google, Volkswagen, Mercedes-Benz, SAP, and dozens of other top global companies are closing stores and suspending sales, production, and operations in Russia in response to its rogue actions.

Perhaps most surprisingly, such divestment includes energy giants such as Shell and BP. Calling Russia's aggression ""senseless,"" Shell said Monday it would opt out of most ties with Gazprom, a Russian-state owned gas company-enterprises totaling about $3 billion.

BP ditched a 20% stake in Russian oil company Rosneft, simultaneously announcing that two BP-nominated Rosneft board members were immediately leaving. BP chair Helge Lund echoed many other business leaders' statements when he said Russia's siege on Ukraine meant the company ""simply cannot continue"" dealing with Russian interests.

ExxonMobil announced that it, too, would extricate itself from a major Russian project.

These individual business decisions are a big deal - companies such as Disney, Apple, Netflix, Ikea, and H&M and latest additions Zara, Samsung, Rolls Royce, Jaguar, GM, Ashton Martin, Netflix, Burberry and Paypal - stand to lose many millions of dollars if not more. But together, these companies' efforts will inflict real damage in the aggregate.

How these brands evidence their protest is as varied as the companies themselves. H&M and Apple are pausing all sales, Nike and Zara are closing stores, HP is suspending shipments, TJX is selling its stake in Familia, Airbus is halting deliveries, Ford and Shell have suspended joint venture operations, Airbnb is providing free housing to refugees, Delta is severing ties with Aeroflot, Disney has halted theatrical releases, Google and YouTube have stopped Russian advertising on their platforms, Netflix is excluding Russian channels from its streaming services, Uber is providing free rides from the Poland/Ukraine border - the list goes on. 

Acting as a private sector army of sorts effectively weaponizing commerce, these brands together might influence the political calculus in this war as much as or more than traditional diplomacy coupled with government sanctions. But the leaders of these companies are not making such divestment decisions in the vacuum of their own ethics and values alone. They're responding to the demands of investors, employees, and perhaps especially, consumers, who more and more are demanding that brands take a stand on issues that matter to them. In fact, the 2022 Edelman Trust Barometer reveals an ever-increasing expectation of business to ""lead"", corresponding with trust in government retreating.

What does ""lead"" mean? A vast majority of consumers say they require brands to wade into social and political waters of great consequence-meaning, like Switzerland, not to stay neutral. In other words, there's no longer any arena that's somehow exempt from ""business matters.""

In 2020 and 2021, the US witnessed major corporate responses to both the Black Lives Matter and associated social movements and the Covid-19 pandemic. But this war is arguably the first real global exercise of movement-making in answer to a single bad actor.

Again, the effect will be greater and more lasting because so many huge corporations are leading the way. Already many smaller companies are following that lead. When one Mom & Pop store stops selling Russian vodka, that's one thing-when a movement of millions shuts of the taps into Putin's war chest, that's world-changing.

You might consider these coalitions of impact rallying against Russia as a Lead With We pilot program for corporate action on the climate emergency and social justice, just to start. In the face of rising scrutiny and expectations from consumers, employees, and investors, and enticed by emerging market forces that reward solutions to today's most pressing stakeholder concerns, brands of all sizes will increasingly be called on to accelerate and scale their impact by working together in new ways.

This approach is urgently needed as the time-lines humanity is working against contract towards us - whether that be the climate emergency, ocean pollution, loss of biodiversity, and more. Done authentically and consistently, this rise of collaborative leadership can course correct the practice and impact of business at perhaps the most critical time in our history.

Ever mindful that so many in Russia want no part in this war, let's hope the atrocities and human tragedy escalating in Ukraine end swiftly and that moving forward business further embraces the critical role it can play in making a more peaceful, regenerative, and equitable future possible. With a hopeful but wary eye, let's watch this space.",0,"Russian Aggression Triggers Unprecedented Response And What It Means For Brand Leadership

6578130912,"Google owner Alphabet is exploring the launch of new Web3 and blockchain-based products, CEO Sundar Pichai says","Google parent Alphabet for the first time publicly embraced Web3 technology on Tuesday, saying it's weighing how to integrate the blockchain-based iteration of the internet.

""On Web3, we are definitely looking at blockchain and such an interesting and powerful technology with broad applications, so much broader again in any one application,"" CEO Sundar Pichai said in Alphabet's quarterly earnings call Tuesday.

""So as a company, we are looking at how we might contribute to the ecosystem and add value.""

Pichai didn't offer any specific glimpses into how exactly the search-engine might make use of blockchains, but hinted at uses within its cloud services department.


""Just one example, our cloud team is looking at how they can support our customers' needs in building, transacting, storing value, and deploying new products on a blockchain-based platform,"" the CEO said.

""So we'll definitely be watching the space closely and supporting it where we can.""

There's debate about what Web3 is, though it's generally agreed to be an evolution from the internet of today, where Alphabet's search engine is dominant.

But the concept is seen by crypto advocates as a stepping stone to the metaverse and an upgrade from the control of Web2's tech giants like Google.

The chief aim of platforms built on Web3 is to cut out the central authorities that act as gatekeepers, and give more power to users who earn their influence by helping to run services themselves.

Jack Dorsey, one of bitcoin's most vocal proponents, has hit back at the idea that Web3 is decentralized, saying venture capitalists like Andreessen Horowitz dominate the field. But Alphabet appears to be warming up to the idea.


""Overall, I think technology will continue to evolve and innovate, and we want to be pro-innovation and approach it that way,"" Pichai said.

""Any time there is innovation, I find it exciting, and I think it is something we want to support the best we can. The web has always evolved, and it's going to continue to evolve,"" he said.

""And as Google, we have benefited tremendously from open-source technologies, and so we do plan to contribute there.""

On Tuesday, Alphabet posted blowout fourth-quarter results that beat Wall Street expectations on revenue and earnings. Quarterly revenue came in at $75.33 billion, up 32% on a year ago and well above the $71.17 billion average estimate from analysts polled by Refinitiv.

6528891390,Why We're Still Waiting For the iCar,"Hey y'all, it's Austin in snowy Boston. Big Tech software is eating the auto world, but first...

Today's top tech news:

Last week, at the annual CES technology conference, carmakers stole the (mostly virtual) show. Big vehicle brands from Chrysler to General Motors to Mercedes-Benz unveiled futuristic concepts, new electric models and flashy features. But while tech companies may have been overshadowed at the gadget pageant, they weren't MIA: Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google each announced significant auto-world partnerships.

Notably, those announcements were about software. Amazon is teaming up with Stellantis NV, maker of Jeep and Chrysler, to develop in-vehicle infotainment and provide cloud services. And BMW touted a model with a high-resolution Amazon Fire TV. Google, meanwhile, revealed a new Volvo integration with its virtual assistant that will enable drivers to pre-heat their vehicles remotely by voice.

In some ways, these kinds of incremental features fall woefully short of a Big Tech-pioneered car that could take on Tesla Inc., disrupt Detroit and compete with Asian and European auto behemoths. For as long as the car has been considered a, ahem, ""mobile device,"" there's been speculation that the likes of Apple Inc. would create their own iCar. But those hardware efforts have sputtered again and again.

Instead, at least in the near term, the biggest tech players have gone after more achievable (and far less costly) software initiatives. You've likely encountered these features if you own a newish car or have plugged your phone into a Hertz rental: Android Auto, Apple's CarPlay, Alexa Auto, etc.

Tech giants are, of course, also engineering more under-the-hood advancements such as self-driving tools, but the more consumer-facing features could prove a lucrative way to sideload their brands inside cars. Think of all the billions of eyeballs that will be staring at screens on the road in the coming years. There's still a relatively untapped audience for apps, content, search and location data, and, yes, likely advertising too.

Tons of cars already come standard with CarPlay, the interface of apps that lets drivers use Apple Music, Apple Maps and other non-Apple apps seamlessly inside their cars. Ford has struck a big partnership with Android, and you can speak with Amazon's Alexa inside your Audi or Toyota. Recognizing that car brands likely don't want technology companies getting in the way of their direct relationship with customers, Microsoft Corp. has pitched itself a neutral software provider. ""We are not pushing a Microsoft brand in the car,"" Sanjay Ravi, Microsoft's automotive industry general manager, told me a few years back. ""We will give you the brain and provide all the elements to create [your own].""

Such software-centric strategies are prudent and may end up being a Trojan Horse for larger vehicle ambitions, but the tech industry's approach isn't without downsides, at least for customers. Right now, depending on the car, for example, Android Auto and Apple CarPlay are usually interchangeable, plug-and-play experiences driven by whatever smartphone the driver has. But if they stop being so flexible, it'd be a pain if your smartphone-driven life no longer integrates with whatever software platform your car runs on.

Another downside would be if the bigger technology players take over the ecosystem, to the point where digital car systems are as boring, duopolistic and as indistinguishable as mobile operating systems are today. I'm not totally optimistic that Nvidia or Toyota can pull off a better alternative, but more digital competition is certainly refreshing.

As for carmakers, they ought to be wary not only of Big Tech's longer-term goals, but also of the invisible impact they may be having on consumer affinity for their brands. My wife and I absolutely love our Subaru Outback, but since Google Maps started freezing recently (and dangerously) on Apple CarPlay, we found ourselves blaming Subaru-not Google or Apple-for the glitches.

After searching online, it seems increasingly likely that my Outback is not at fault (sorry, Subie!). Until the problem is fixed, I'll be driving my car the old-fashioned way, without any plugged-in Apple, Amazon or Google apps. So far, I haven't notice a difference. -Austin Carr

6662848740,"ANALYSIS-As Russia invades Ukraine, Moscow battles big tech to control the narrative","By Elizabeth Culliford

NEW YORK/MOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - As Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, another battle took place online and over the airwaves.

Moscow ramped up efforts to control the narrative playing out in news media and on tech platforms, while big tech companies Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google put restrictions on Russia's state-controlled media outlets in Ukraine and around the world.

On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. By Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.

Images and videos were slower to load on Facebook after the slowdown was announced, according to users, while Facebook Messenger had long periods of not loading at all. On mobile devices, Twitter remained slow - it has been the subject of a punitive slowdown since March. Many state websites, including the Kremlin site kremlin.ru, have also suffered outages in recent days.

For the tech companies, the stand-off is the latest step in an ongoing confrontation with Russia where platforms risk government-imposed restrictions in the country as it seeks to censor dissidents while protecting state-run media.

Major social, video and livestreaming platforms from Facebook to TikTok and Twitch are coming under increasing pressure to combat falsehoods on their platforms relating to the conflict, including the spread of misleading footage.

The escalation of Russia's clash with big tech comes days before a deadline Moscow set for major foreign tech companies to comply with a new law that requires them to set up official representation in the country, which could make it easier for the Kremlin to regulate platforms. It follows a series of fines and slowdowns imposed on platforms which the Russian government said failed to remove illegal content.

Ahead of the March deadline, an online list by Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor showed only Apple , Spotify and Viber had fulfilled all three requirements of the law as of 2145 GMT on Sunday. They are: registering an account with the regulator, giving users a way to communicate directly with the company, and setting up a representative office.

This month, Russia threatened the companies with an advertising ban if they do not comply. Harsher restrictions that could follow include speed slowdowns or outright blocks, Russian officials have said.

Big tech companies also face the burden of weighing demands from Ukrainian officials and sympathizers worldwide who have called on them to expel Russian users from their services to stop the spread of false information, while also preserving the access of dissidents to vital digital tools.

""Mark Zuckerberg, while you create Metaverse - Russia ruins real life in Ukraine! We ask you to ban access to @facebookapp and @instagram from Russia - as long as tanks and missiles attack our kindergartens and hospitals!"" Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov wrote on Twitter on Sunday.

Responding to the demands, Meta's head of global affairs Nick Clegg tweeted on Sunday that turning off Facebook and Instagram in Russia would ""silence important expression at a crucial time.""

It was clear others across the tech landscape were grappling with similar dilemmas. Just minutes after saying in a post on Sunday that the Telegram messaging app would consider restricting some channels for spreading false information, founder Pavel Durov said the company would no longer do so after receiving feedback from users.

 RESTRICTIONS

The activities of state-controlled media such as RT and Sputnik, which were hit with new EU sanctions on Sunday, has been a key source of conflict between Moscow and major tech platforms, as activists and politicians demanded the companies demonetize or ban the Kremlin-sponsored outlets.

Roskomnadzor has warned local media not to circulate what it called ""false information"" about Moscow's military operation, banning the use of the words ""invasion"" and ""assault"" to describe its attack on Ukraine. Russian tech giant Yandex has also started warning Russian users looking for news about Ukraine on its search engine about unreliable information on the internet.

Russia calls its actions a ""special operation"" that it says is not designed to occupy territory but to destroy Ukraine's military capabilities and capture individuals who it sees as dangerous nationalists - something the government in Kyiv and Western powers say is baseless propaganda.

State-run media has long been a contentious presence on major social platforms, some of which label those accounts in an effort to be more transparent about the source of information.

Amid Russia's invasion, Facebook, Twitter, Google and its video streaming service YouTube took new measures to restrict Russian state media from making money from ads on their sites. Twitter, which banned ads from state-backed media in 2019, said it was pausing all ads in Russia and Ukraine to ensure the visibility of public safety information. Google, the world's biggest ad seller, also said it was not allowing Russian state media to sell ads using its tools.

Facebook and Google also said they had restricted access to some state media accounts in Ukraine at the request of the Ukrainian government. Google said on Sunday it had banned downloads of RT's mobile app in Ukraine in response to a government legal request.

As Western companies begin to heed new economic new sanctions against Russia and pressure mounts to combat online disinformation, experts say the fight between Russia and the most powerful tech companies may intensify.

 By Elizabeth Culliford

NEW YORK/MOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - As Russian missiles rained down on Ukrainian cities, another battle took place online and over the airwaves.

Moscow ramped up efforts to control the narrative playing out in news media and on tech platforms, while big tech companies Facebook-owner Meta Platforms Inc and Alphabet Inc's Google put restrictions on Russia's state-controlled media outlets in Ukraine and around the world.

On Friday, Russia said it would partially restrict Facebook, a move Meta said came after it refused a government request to stop the independent fact-checking of several Russian state media outlets. By Saturday, Twitter also said its service was being restricted for some Russian users.

Images and videos were slower to load on Facebook after the slowdown was announced, according to users, while Facebook Messenger had long periods of not loading at all. On mobile devices, Twitter remained slow - it has been the subject of a punitive slowdown since March. Many state websites, including the Kremlin site kremlin.ru, have also suffered outages in recent days.

For the tech companies, the stand-off is the latest step in an ongoing confrontation with Russia where platforms risk government-imposed restrictions in the country as it seeks to censor dissidents while protecting state-run media.

Major social, video and livestreaming platforms from Facebook to TikTok and Twitch are coming under increasing pressure to combat falsehoods on their platforms relating to the conflict, including the spread of misleading footage.

The escalation of Russia's clash with big tech comes days before a deadline Moscow set for major foreign tech companies to comply with a new law that requires them to set up official representation in the country, which could make it easier for the Kremlin to regulate platforms. It follows a series of fines and slowdowns imposed on platforms which the Russian government said failed to remove illegal content.

Ahead of the March deadline, an online list by Russia's communications regulator Roskomnadzor showed only Apple , Spotify and Viber had fulfilled all three requirements of the law as of 2145 GMT on Sunday. They are: registering an account with the regulator, giving users a way to communicate directly with the company, and setting up a representative office.

This month, Russia threatened the companies with an advertising ban if they do not comply. Harsher restrictions that could follow include speed slowdowns or outright blocks, Russian officials have said.

Big tech companies also face the burden of weighing demands from Ukrainian officials and sympathizers worldwide who have called on them to expel Russian users from their services to stop the spread of false information, while also preserving the access of dissidents to vital digital tools.

The 'Spicy Fish Diss' aimed at McDonald's is a prime example of how pop culture and good ol' fashioned tension can make for an advertising hit. Pusha T. [Source Images: Arby's; Victor Boyko/Getty Images For Kenzo] By Jeff Beer6 minute Read

Like any worthwhile surprise, the latest rap diss track came out of seemingly nowhere. On March 21, rapper Pusha T dropped ""Spicy Fish Diss,"" which lit up the internet immediately. This time Pusha wasn't aiming his ire at Drake or any other rapper, but instead at McDonald's and its Filet-O-Fish sandwich, all on behalf of fast-food underdog Arby's. If this sounds at all bonkers, welcome to pop culture in 2022.

What made this even more compelling was that Pusha was not just a paid spokesattacker or a particularly passionate consumer of fast-food fried fish. No, Pusha was apparently relishing this project to continue his claim that he wrote-and was underpaid for-McDonald's global tagline and song ""I'm Lovin' It,"" which launched in 2003. Pusha told Rolling Stone this week that his spicy take was inspired by resentment over lack of credit and payment. ""I did it at a very young age, at a very young time in my career where I wasn't asking for as much money and ownership,"" he said. ""It's something that's always dug at me later in life like, 'Dammit, I was a part of this and I should have more stake.' It was like half a million or a million dollars for me and my brother-but that's peanuts for as long as that's been running.""

""I'm the reason the whole world love it, now I gotta crush it/Filet-O-Fish is sh*t/You should be disgusted/How dare you sell a square fish asking us to trust it/A half slice of cheese, Mickey D's on a budget?""

Coming just over a month after his latest Ye-produced single ""Diet Coke,"" (which was definitely not a branded track), the overall online reaction to ""Spicy Fish Diss"" was Supa Hot Fire-ing across social media. Fans were, um, lovin' it. According to marketing analytics firm Apex Marketing, within just a couple of days, the song had generated $8 million in advertising value for the brand.

As a single piece of advertising, this is a bonafide hit. Brands continue to pan for pop cultural gold in the hopes that it'll get them any attention, and you could do much worse than enlisting the world's preeminent diss-track rapper to take a swing at your industry's largest player. In evaluating it, ad strategy heads have spent the week asking themselves, Why this celeb? Why this brand? Is there a genuine pop culture insight here? Is the brand appropriating pop culture or participating?

advertisement

""Spicy Fish Diss"" answers all of these pretty emphatically while effectively tapping into the cultural alignment between an industry that has historically been unafraid to diss rivals-from Where's The Beef? to Burger King's brilliant Whopper Detour-and a category of music where diss tracks are an established genre. It participates in the culture by allowing itself to be used as a tool by Pusha T to inflict his own version of revenge for a decades-old resentment. You could also say that Arby's isn't even new to using hip-hop hype as a boost in cultural clout, if we count the Pharrell Grammys Tweet of 2014. Hey @Pharrell, can we have our hat back? #GRAMMYs - Arbys (@Arbys) January 27, 2014

OKAY, BUT WHAT ABOUT . . .

All that said, let's indulge on why this may not be the fast-food finishing move that it might initially appear to be. First, the backstory. As previously stated, Pusha told Rolling Stone that the inspiration was his resentment (real or perceived) over underpayment for a McDonald's jingle 20 years ago, and not solely the tasty delights of Arby's fish sandwich. One senior ad exec told me that almost any CMO would see this as a distraction. Arby's CMO Patrick Schwing will have to balance between the cool-kid attention for pulling off this marketing coup and the risk that all the love for Pusha redirects the spotlight away from the fact that the point here is supposed to be that Arby's has what is reputedly an excellent new fish sandwich that you should try. That, and all the chatter about how Pusha snuck a coke reference into his ad.

advertisement

Second, and more importantly, this is the year 2022. In the very recent past, McDonald's has given us BTS tote bags and Saweetie N' Sour sauce, while Popeye's served up Megan Thee Stallion Hottie Sauce. Where's the Pusha-themed merch drop, Arby's? One of the genius aspects of the McDonald's Famous Meals is how it's coordinated with original products, music, social media, and more.

Third, let's just talk about the Filet-O-Fish as the focal point here. I get that Arby's is trying to sell their own fish sandwich. But you're the 15th-ranked fast-feeder in America, taking aim at the clown-faced behemoth at the top-and you're not even using one of its top sellers as ammunition? It's like using Bill Wennington to diss the '98 Bulls. Should Arby's, which, after all, is generally oriented around its ""We have the meats"" campaign, have used the spicy fish sandwich launch to attack McDonald's burgers?MORE TENSION, PLEASE

Seven-foot Canadian NBA role players aside, Arby's obviously got a lot incredibly right here. Not only because it nudges us dangerously closer to the commercial jingle-dominated future predicted by Demolition Man in 1993, but also in its creative use of tension to gain our attention. It's an age-old tactic, but one that simply isn't used enough. When Coke and Pepsi fight in public, it boosts both brands' visibility and the audience's interest in what will happen next. Were you and I-much less Hypebeast, GQ, Complex, and Rolling Stone-talking about Arby's two weeks ago? Exactly.

Our human brains are wired for stories, and the best stories have tension. It's conflict that makes the resolution interesting. Not enough marketers embrace tension to really tell us who they are or what they-and their product-are about. There are always a few examples sprinkled throughout the years, beyond even soda and burgers, and often it's this work (if done well) that gets us talking. The long-running Mac versus PC campaign is arguably one of Apple's best and most beloved. Samsung turned the tables on Apple years later, and it added more personality to its brand proposition. More recently, when Neil Young pulled his entire catalog off Spotify in protest of Joe Rogan in January, Apple Music quickly put out tweets and push notifications declaring itself ""the home of Neil Young,"" and put a ""We Love Neil"" playlist at the front of its browse section, all of which was covered by the culture and tech press like it was the latest move in a brand beef. Because it was. The home of Neil Young. Listen to his entire catalog on Apple Music: https://t.co/sUGtz4JbB9 pic.twitter.com/YgRMygUqhi - Apple Music (@AppleMusic) January 28, 2022

That tension doesn't even need to be directed at a specific competitor. Witness how Ben & Jerry's uses everything from podcasts to new flavors to tap into the cultural tension of where it stands on social and environmental issues. Or Patagonia stitching that tension right into its shorts with its Vote the Assholes Out label calling out climate deniers ahead of the 2020 election. There's also consumer tension, in terms of what problem this brand can help you solve. Nike has built its empire on using the tension between the athlete we are and the athlete we want to be to create some of the most stylish and persuasive advertising in history.

advertisement

According to the ad folks I talked to about ""Spicy Fish Diss,"" whatever flavor of tension a brand chooses, it has to ring true. One senior source said, ""The internet sniffs out posers and interlopers from a mile away. So I'm always looking to see if the strings are showing. Does it feel authentic? Do they understand the culture?""

Otherwise, that sought-after, and ever-lucrative, audience your lusting after will smell something . . . fishy.

"
6578134319,Google's Earnings Blockbuster Proves Its Primacy,"Google Logo (Photo by Sean Gallup/Getty Images) The world's best company is being built in plain sight. And there is nothing that regulators, politicians or propogandists can do about it.

 Executives at Alphabet (GOOGL) reported on Tuesday that profits in the fourth quarter reached $20.6 billion, up more than a third. Then they threw in a 20-for-1 stock split. This is getting good.

 We have recommended Alphabet in our Digital Transformation portfolio since April 2020 and are up 115% since. Yet there is clearly more to come.

 Long-term investors should own Alphabet shares despite the big run to date. Let me explain.

 Tech journalists love to hate Alphabet, the parent company of Google. It's a big change in perception. The Mountainview, Calif.-based company began in the 1990s as a favorite among reporters. They loved the utility of Google search and YouTube. Back in the day Google was the upstart, battling against the establishment of Yahoo and Lycos. Then executives figured out how to make money for shareholders, lots of it.

 The competitive advantage at Alphabet is executives hire the best people to build software that people actually want to use. It started with search, email, Internet browsers, and online videos, via YouTube. Then they gave it all away for free.

 That's the rub. Haters these days say those tools, that they all still use by the way, are not free. Detractors say the Google part of Alphabet is scraping personal data and selling that information to advertisers.

 This is preposterous. It is not how advertising works. It's also a childish view of the world where large corporations give away free stuff without any strings attached.

 Alphabet, and the rest of big tech, including Apple (AAPL) Microsoft (MSFT) Amazon.com (AMZN) Meta Platforms (FB) Nvidia (NVDA) and Tesla (TSLA) are winning despite the critics because they build stuff that their patrons absolutely love. And all of these businesses continue to grow quickly.

 However, the potential of Alphabet is head and shoulders above all of the rest. In an era of data science, Alphabet is the undisputed leader because they attract the best talent.

 Executives enlisted Google Mind, its wholly owned artificial intelligence division to begin work in 2017 to better monetize YouTube. The engineers soon discovered that users would be OK viewing far more ads if they were unfolded inside the video, as opposed to the beginning. Today YouTube is a bigger business than Netflix (NFLX), and growing faster too.

 The official Q4 financial statement shows YouTube logged $8.6 billion in sales, up 25%. Netflix posted revenues of $7.7 billion over the same period, up 16%.

 The same game plan has been ramped up at Google Cloud. Although Google began life as a cloud-first business, executives didn't begin selling its excess data storage and computer processing until 2008. By that time the company was way behind Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, the cloud business out of Redmond.

 Thomas Kurian came on as chief executive in 2019. The former Oracle executive immediately got to work hiring staff.

 During the Q4 conference call with analysts Tuesday Sundar Pichai, Alphabet's chief executive explained that the company backlog increased 70% to $51 billion, on the strength of new business at Google Cloud. Deals over $1 billion in annual billings increased 65%. For the quarter cloud revenue soared to $5.5 billion, up 45%.

 There is a pattern. Alphabet hires the best people to help build software customers love.

 It's a strategy that works. Alphabet hired 6,500 new full-time staff during Q4. The official headcount is now 156,500. The hires reveal confidence in the direction of the business and future prospects.

 The same is true of the 20-for-1 stock split. Some media talking heads will go out of their way to argue that stock splits to not impact the financial underpinnings of the business. This is true, and it misses the point. Stock splits tell investors, and potential new hires that management is confident the share price will continue to rise as future products come to market.

 At a price of $2,552.88 shares trade at 24.6x forward earnings and 7.4x sales. This is cheap given the growth of YouTube and Google Cloud.

 Long-term investors should look for an entry point in coming weeks.

 At a price of $2,552.88 shares trade at 24.6x forward earnings and 7.4x sales. This is cheap given the growth of YouTube and Google Cloud.

 Long-term investors should look for an entry point in coming weeks.

6578115853,Alphabet eyes $2 trillion value after blowout results,"Feb 2 (Reuters) - Google parent company Alphabet Inc advanced nearer to joining peers Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp in the elite $2 trillion market valuation club on Wednesday as the search giant's shares surged more than 8% following a blowout quarterly report.

 Last trading at about $2,975, Alphabet's stock was on track for its largest one-day percentage gain in almost two years, easing concerns around owning Big Tech following a sector-wide selloff in the past few weeks.

 Alphabet's stock market value peaked just above $2 trillion after the start of the trading session, and was last at $1.97 trillion. That includes class B shares that do not trade on the stock market and are held by insiders.

 A close above $2 trillion would be the first ever for the Mountain View, California-based company.

 ""The technology sector started 2022 with some of the biggest question marks over it since the dotcom crash more than two decades ago,"" said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""However, the largest and highest quality U.S. tech names continue to deliver the answers the market wants with big earnings beats.""

 Shares of Wall Street's most valuable companies have soared in the past two years, driven by pandemic-led shifts in how people work and learn, even as regulators around the world scrutinize them over allegations of breaches of privacy and antitrust concerns.

 At least 20 brokerages raised their price targets on Alphabet's stock after the company late on Tuesday delivered record quarterly sales that topped expectations. The median analyst price target is now $3,450, 16% above its current price.

 Alphabet also announced a 20-to-1 stock split, which will give shareholders 19 shares for every share they hold.

 Splitting stocks is a method companies use to woo investors by making them more affordable. However, some brokerages, such as Robinhood Markets, allow investors to buy fractions of shares, making the tactic less effective.

 Tesla Inc and Apple split their stocks in 2000 to make their shares more appealing to mom-and-pop investors.

 ""The split will make the shares more accessible for retail investors and likely facilitate inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (which is somehow still share price-weighted), but it has no fundamental impact,"" J.P. Morgan analyst Doug Anmuth said.

 Facebook parent Meta Platforms, which is set to report results on Wednesday after the bell, was last up 1.1%.

 Adding to the rebound in tech stocks, Advanced Micro Devices Inc's shares jumped over 5% after its results topped Wall Street expectations. Rivals Nvidia Corp, Qualcomm Inc and Micron Technology Inc also rose.
